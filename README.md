# NOTICE

Thank you for your interest in WarpShare.

WarpShare was originally a part of the MoKee Open Source Project and was never released as a standalone application (nor were there any plans for such a release). As a result, it is not expected to work properly on any other Android ROMs.

It's important to note that both WarpShare and MoKee as a whole were discontinued in January 2023. Consequently, there may be compatibility issues with current Android versions, and we do not have any intentions to address or continue the maintenance of the project.

We thank you for your understanding of the project's status.

Best regards,
